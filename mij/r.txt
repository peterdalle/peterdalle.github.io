## Introduction to the R programming language

<img src="r.png" alt="R" style="width:150px">

The R programming language [was developed 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) and is specially suited for statistics, data analysis and visualization. Basically, it's a fancy calculator.

R has a command line interface, which means that you type in commands by hand. However, there are graphical interfaces, such as RStudio, which helps a lot.
