## The Python programming language

<img src="python.png" alt="Python" style="width:150px">

The Python programming language [was developed 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and is an easy to read programming language that many journalists and data scientists use. It's easy to get started compared to many other languages.

Python a interpretative language, which means that Python reads and executes text files. Many other programming languages compile to binary, which means that a text file is converted to machine code. But we don't have to bother with that, fortunately.

## Install Python

Python is free and open source. It works on Windows, Mac and Linux.

We will use **Anaconda**, which also installs many add-ons that enhance Python (like notebooks).

> **[Download and install Anaconda with Python 3.5](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)**
>
> Choose the 64-bit version (or 32-bit version if you don't know the difference). The download is about 400 MB so it'll take some time on a slow connection. Just click OK to accept the defaults during installation.

## Create your first Python program

You can execute Python code in two ways (don't worry, we will cover everything on the lecture if you have no idea what is going on):

### Run code via a notebook

The first way is to run code via an interactive shell called Jupyter Notebooks. This is the preferred method because it's easier, interactive and more fun.

1. Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac).

2. Type `jupyter notebook` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

3. A web page should open.

4. Create a notebook and write this in a cell and press <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> to execute:

<pre>print("Hello World!")</pre>

5. If everything works, `Hello World!` will appear on your screen.

### Run code via a file

The second and old-fashioned way is to run code via your [command prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) or [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell).

1. Create a text file named `helloworld.py` and save it somewhere on your computer. Note that Python files end with `.py`.

2. Put this text inside the text file and save it:

<pre>print("Hello World!")</pre>

3. Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac) and execute your program by writing `python helloworld.py` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

4. If everything works, `Hello World!` will appear on your screen.


## Lecture objectives

After the lectures, you will have some knowledge in how to:

- Getting data by scraping web pages
- Getting data by API
- Write a simple news robot

The examination for this part of the course is to write a news robot that follows simple rules and produce a journalistic text.

You will be given code that you can modify, so you don't have to write anything from scratch.

We want you to be able to *think* like a programmer, not necessarily become a programmer.

## Code for workshops

All Python code for workshops and examinations are located at GitHub: <https://github.com/peterdalle/mij>

## Resources to learn Python

### Web sites

Do you have to buy a book? No, internet is often more than enough. Google is your friend.

- Learn Python basics: <http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/>
- Pythons own site is helpful: <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>
- Ask questions, or find answers, about Python on StackOverflow: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python>
- Find code projects on GitHub: <https://github.com/>
- Python documentation at is mandatory reading if you're advanced: <https://docs.python.org/3/>
